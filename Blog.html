                <p>Dating can be stressful. First-date jitters are no joke, especially when you're meeting someone in real life for the first time after meeting on a dating app or from a set-up from your friends. But for all the stress that goes into dating, it also has its perks, with everything from new relationship euphoria if it works out, to possibly making a new friend if it doesn't, to just having a fun night out and getting out of your normal routine. No matter what happens, you're not alone in your journey to finding the one—or the one-nighter. So here are some of our personal favorite dating bolgs.</p>

                     <a href="https://www.globaldatinginsights.com/" target="_blank"><h3> Global Dating Insights</h3></a>
                     <p>This site is unique because it’s not so much about dating advice, but rather data and news in the online dating industry itself.

                        In addition to news articles and interviews, the site also publishes the annual GDI Power Book, which lists key influencers and startups in the dating sector.

                    <a href="https://www.baggagereclaim.co.uk/" target="_blank"> <h3>Baggage Reclaim</h3></a>
                     <p>Blogger Natalie Lue created this blog in 2005 when she had an awakening of sorts after dealing with a breakup on top of coping with a serious illness. She documented her journey of reclaiming herself from her emotional baggage and working to boost her self-esteem, set boundaries, and acknowledge her fears of abandonment and rejection.

                        She shares her life lessons and advice with readers via blog posts, podcasts, books, and online courses. As she explains on the site, “I’d love to help you too, saving you a great deal of time, energy, effort and money so that you feel less stressed, anxious, frustrated, resentful, doubting and more, and instead, more confident, loving, trusting, and free.”</p><br>
